This could be done in Copr as a pure pypi source module except for 
two bugs:
- https://github.com/fedora-python/pyp2rpm/issues/121
- https://github.com/fedora-python/pyp2rpm/issues/116

So we used pyp2rpm on Fedora (because the one in EL7 is pretty old and does
not support the epel7 template) and modified the resulting specfile to add the
BuildRequires: python2-greenlet and set the PYTHONPATH for sphinx-build

$ pyp2rpm -d $(rpm --eval %{_topdir}) -t epel7 greenlet-0.4.2.zip > python-greenlet.spec
$ ed <<"EOF" python-greenlet.spec
/BuildRequires/i
BuildRequires:  python2-greenlet
.
/sphinx-build doc html/s/^/PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD\/doc /
w
q
EOF

And due to: https://github.com/fedora-python/pyp2rpm/issues/118

$ ed <<EOF python-greenlet.spec
/^Source0:/s/$/http:\/\/pypi\.python\.org\/packages\/source\/g\/gevent\/gevent-1.0.1.zip/
w
q
EOF

And due to https://github.com/fedora-python/pyp2rpm/issues/119:
$ ed <<EOF python-greenlet.spec
/python2-setuptools/s/python2-setuptools/python-setuptools/
w
q
EOF
